# bunnyhopfix
CS:S Bhop delay (jump prediction) fixer based on [Alkatraz](https://github.com/alkatrazbhop)'s [BunnyhopAPE](https://github.com/alkatrazbhop/BunnyhopAPE) with modern C++ techniques and planned Linux support.
 
## How to use
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/b1scoito/bunnyhopfix/releases/latest).  
Open it and run with the game opened. The game will be then patched.

### Warning
Because it writes into the game's memory, it is required to have the `-insecure` option on for security reasons.

### Todo
- [ ] Linux support (port to CMake prior to this)
- [ ] Code organization
